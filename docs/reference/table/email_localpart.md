# Email local part

The module 'table.email\_localpart' extracts and unescapes local ("username") part
of the email address.

E.g.
test@example.org => test
"test @ a"@example.org => test @ a

Mappings for invalid emails are not defined (will be treated as non-existing
values).

```
table.email_localpart { }
```

`table.email_localpart_optional` works the same, but returns non-email strings
as is. This can be used if you want to accept both `user@example.org` and
`user` somewhere and treat it the same.
